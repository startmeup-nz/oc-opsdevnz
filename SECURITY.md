# Security Policy

If you discover a vulnerability in `oc-opsdevnz`, email [john@opsdev.nz](mailto:john@opsdev.nz). When possible, encrypt the report using the GPG key published on [pgp.net.nz](https://pgp.net.nz/) for that address. Please avoid public issues or pull requests until we have a fix ready.

When reporting:

1. Include reproduction steps or a proof-of-concept.
2. Share the impact (e.g., credential disclosure, privilege escalation).
3. Provide the versions/commit hashes you tested.

We aim to acknowledge new reports within 2 business days and will keep you updated as we investigate.
